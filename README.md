# Image Captioning with BLIP Model in Google Colab

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform image captioning using the BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. The project is implemented in a Google Colab notebook, allowing users to upload an image and receive a descriptive caption generated by the model.

## Features

- Upload an image file from your local system.
- Generate a descriptive caption for the uploaded image using the BLIP model.
- Run the entire process in a Google Colab notebook.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab (for running the notebook)
- Required Python libraries: `transformers`, `torch`, `torchvision`, `PIL`

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image:**
   - Click on the file upload button that appears in the Colab notebook and select an image file from your local system.

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   - Execute each cell sequentially to install libraries, load the model, upload an image, and generate a caption.

3. **View the Results:**
   - The generated caption for the uploaded image will be displayed in the output cell.
